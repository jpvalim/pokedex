# A simple pokedex created using java script

It uses the https://pokeapi.co/ to download the pokemon data.
Used to practice java script and how to get informations to my project from an API **using only java script.**
Learned how to use the **async fetch function**, **promisses** concepts and how to interact with DOM.

Thanks to Digital Inovation one to help me on this journey!
